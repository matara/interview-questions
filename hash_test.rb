# Unexpected was asking me to reimplement a hash class with Â  arrays. Why would I ever do this?
# It's a base class with well understood functionality, and the actual implementation in any
# language would be highly optimized. I've heard the arguments about "testing the way you think about
# things" and I don't buy it, especially when you only have 50 minutes to do it. What about testing
# the way I'd actually write code every day?

  def []=(key, value)
    keys.push(key)
    @storage[index_of_key(key)] = value
